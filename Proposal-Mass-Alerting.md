# Mass Alerting Architecture Proposal
Author: Alex  
Status: Implemented (Sanitized Version)

## Overview
The organization lacked any mechanism for mass alerting during widespread outages, site-down events, or critical operational disruptions. Communication during these events was inconsistent, manual, and dependent on ad-hoc messaging. This proposal introduces a centralized, automated mass alerting architecture capable of delivering rapid, location-aware notifications to all relevant teams and stakeholders.

## Problem Statement
- No unified system existed for company-wide or site-wide alerts.
- Outages required manual coordination across multiple teams.
- Communication delays increased incident duration and operational impact.
- No audit trail existed for who was notified, when, or through which channel.
- Existing tools (Nagios, SIEM, Atera) were not designed for mass broadcast.

## Requirements
- Ability to send alerts to all employees or specific locations.
- Automated triggering from monitoring systems.
- Human-readable audit trail for compliance and post-incident review.
- Multi-channel delivery (chat, SMS, email).
- Routing logic based on severity and location.
- Integration with existing monitoring tools.

## Proposed Architecture
The mass alerting system is built on a layered model:

### Monitoring Layer
- Nagios, SIEM, and other monitoring tools generate alerts.
- Thresholds and outage checks trigger webhook events.

### Communication & Routing Layer
- Alerts enter a dedicated chat ingestion channel.
- Pattern-matching determines severity, location, and routing.
- Message bus provides internal collaboration and auditability.

### Notification Delivery Layer
- API-driven SMS delivery for rapid broadcast.
- Location-based groups for targeted messaging.
- Delivery logging for traceability.

### Recipient Layer
- On-call teams
- NOC/SOC
- Engineering
- Executives
- Company-wide distribution groups

### Logging & Intelligence Layer
- SIEM ingests all alert events, chat messages, and SMS logs.
- Provides correlation, retention, and compliance visibility.

## Expected Outcomes
- Rapid, consistent communication during outages.
- Reduced time-to-awareness for critical incidents.
- Clear audit trail for compliance and postmortem analysis.
- Scalable architecture for future integrations.
- Foundation for automated escalation workflows.

## Summary
This proposal established the organization’s first mass alerting capability. It replaced manual, inconsistent communication with a structured, automated, and auditable system capable of supporting high-severity operational events.
